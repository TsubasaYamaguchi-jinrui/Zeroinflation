  abstract  = "This O'Reilly cookbook provides more than 150 recipes to help
               scientists, engineers, programmers, and data analysts generate
               high-quality graphs quickly---without having to comb through all
               the details of R's graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a
               specific problem with a solution you can apply to your own
               project and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe
               works.Most of the recipes in this second edition use the updated
               version of the ggplot2 package, a powerful and flexible way to
               make graphs in R. You'll also find expanded content about the
               visual design of graphics. If you have at least a basic
               understanding of the R language, you're ready to get started
               with this easy-to-use reference.Use R's default graphics for
               quick exploration of dataCreate a variety of bar graphs, line
               graphs, and scatter plotsSummarize data distributions with
               histograms, density curves, box plots, and moreProvide

  abstract  = "Learn how to use R to turn raw data into insight, knowledge, and
               understanding. This book introduces you to R, RStudio, and the
               tidyverse, a collection of R packages designed to work together
               to make data science fast, fluent, and fun. Suitable for readers
               with no previous programming experience, R for Data Science is
               designed to get you doing data science as quickly as
               possible.Authors Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund guide you
               through the steps of importing, wrangling, exploring, and
               modeling your data and communicating the results. You'll get a
               complete, big-picture understanding of the data science cycle,
               along with basic tools you need to manage the details. Each
               section of the book is paired with exercises to help you
               practice what you've learned along the way.You'll learn how
               to:Wrangle---transform your datasets into a form convenient for
               analysisProgram---learn powerful R tools for solving data
               problems with greater clarity and easeExplore---examine your
               data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test themModel---provide
               a low-dimensional summary that captures true ``signals'' in your
               datasetCommunicate---learn R Markdown for integrating prose,
